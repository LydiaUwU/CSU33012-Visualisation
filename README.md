Visualising developer productivity with Minecraft! This is my novel approach to "visualising" a developer's productivity using data pulled from the GitHub API, where various aspects and statistics on a given developer are converted to parameters that control Minecraft's world generation. This will mean that more active developers should have more interesting and resource filled worlds to explore!

## Usage
After cloning the repo, a datapack based on any github user can be generated by running `./gh2mc "username"`. If you are running the program for the first time you will be prompted to provide your GitHub authorisation token, this will then be stored in `./credentials.json` for any future usage of the program.

Once the program has finished running a new directory, `./github_worldgen/`, will have been created. This is the datapack, and it is ready for installation and usage in Minecraft 1.18.X. To use this datapack launch Minecraft 1.18.X, choose `Single Player` and then `Create New World`. Then choose the various settings you'd like for the world (name, gamemode, etc) and then click `Data Packs`. On this screen you can drag the `./github_worldgen/` folder onto the game window, and choosing `Yes`. Lastly, click on the datapack's icon and it should move over to the `Selected Pack` column, then pressing `Done` followed by `Create New World`.

To verify the correct installation of the datapack you can run `/datapack list` and the pack should be visible in the list.

## Parameter changes
